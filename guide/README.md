## 🧠 Key Concepts Explained

### 🌍 **Cross-Chain Technology**
This project uses LayerZero to enable seamless communication between different blockchain networks. Your tokens can exist on multiple chains and move between them.

### 🚫 **Global Mint Restriction**
The unique feature of this system: each user can only mint tokens **once across ALL supported chains**. This prevents farming and ensures fair distribution.

### 🏪 **Multi-Pool System**
Four different "pools" with different rules:
- Pool 1: Free mint (whitelist required)
- Pool 2: WL GTD (whitelist required)  
- Pool 3: WL FCFS (whitelist required)
- Pool 4: Public mint (anyone)

### 🔗 **LayerZero Integration**
- Enables cross-chain messaging
- Synchronizes mint status across chains
- Allows token transfers between networks
- Maintains security and decentralization
